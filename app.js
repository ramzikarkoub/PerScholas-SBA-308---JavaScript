// I. Variables & Datatypes

// A. Q + A

// How do we assign a value to a variable?
let firstName = "Ramzi";
// How do we change the value of a variable?
firstName = "karkoub";
// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
let newVariable = firstName;
// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
Declare: " create avariable using var, let or const";
Assign: "give a value to a variable";
Define: "Combining declaration and assignment";
// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
pseudocoding: "write the scope of work in plain text as a comment, describe the step that will do to inpliment the solution";
// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
let answer =
  "think about the question and how to impliment it for maybe 60% and im pliment it in coding: 40%";

//   B. Strings
// For all other questions that involve writing code, you can solve them via the following instructions.

// Create a variable called firstVariable
let firstVariable;
// Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
firstVariable = "Hello World";
// Change the value of this variable to some number
firstVariable = "Wazuuuup!!!";
// Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
let secondVariable = firstVariable;

// Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
secondVariable = "Yooo! Wazuuuuuup!!!";
// What is the value of firstVariable?
("Wazuuuup!!!");
// Create a variable called yourNameand set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
// ex: Hello, my name is Jean Valjean
let myName = "Ramzi Karkoub";
let newName = `Hello, my name is ${myName}`;
